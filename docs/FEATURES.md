## Testing Requirements

Each feature must be tested with:
1. **Browser screenshots** - Visual confirmation
2. **Data validation** - Correct algorithm behavior
3. **Edge cases** - Handle unusual inputs
4. **Performance** - Works with 100/1K/10K profiles

## Algorithm Documentation

### Dating Socialism Algorithm

**Core Principle**: Inverse popularity visibility

**Formula** (simplified):
```
user_visibility = base_visibility √ó (average_LPW / user_LPW)

Where:
- base_visibility = 1.0 (100%)
- average_LPW = median likes per week across all users
- user_LPW = this user's likes per week

Result: Users with more likes become less visible
```

**Fringe Dating Boost**:
```
fringe_score = count(user_prefs_outside_mainstream ‚à© viewer_prefs)
visibility_boost = fringe_score √ó fringe_multiplier
```

### Bullseye Preference Matching

**Tiers**:
1. **Must-Have** (Inner circle) - Deal breakers
2. **Strong Preference** (Middle ring) - Important but flexible
3. **Nice-to-Have** (Outer ring) - Minor preferences
4. **Outside Preferences** (Beyond target) - Show with indicator

**Scoring**:
- Must-have match: +100 points
- Strong preference match: +50 points
- Nice-to-have match: +25 points
- Mismatch penalty: Varies by tier
