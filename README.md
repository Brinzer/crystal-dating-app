# Crystal Dating App

## Pre-Alpha Demo Version

A revolutionary dating app built on principles of **transparency**, **equity**, and **meaningful connection**.

### Core Philosophy

**Dating Socialism**: Inverse popularity algorithm that reduces visibility for highly-liked users to equalize match opportunities across all users.
